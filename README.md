# AppPrevisaoTempo
Mobile simple app that search weather condition and temperature based on the city supplied on input box

A project based on code supplied on book "Fullstack React Native by Abbott, Djirdeh, Accomazzo and Shoemaker"

I use Expo to run the show and after it loads the app, you can input a city on the search input box, with 
"Bora procurar qual cidade?" label , which means "Search which city" in Brazilian portuguese.
